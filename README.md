# bridge-faucet-bch-ui

This is a fork of [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter). It's used to create a front end UI or interacting with the AVAX-SLP bridge. This UI adds two new menu items to the web wallet:

- The **Faucet** View lets users request test tokens from the [bridge-faucet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bridge-faucet) API.
- The **Bridge** View lets users sent test tokens across the bridge to an address on the AVAX blockchain.
